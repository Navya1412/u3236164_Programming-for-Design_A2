The goal of this assignment was to create websites each showing a different JavaScript skill I have learnt in the past 3 weeks in class.

For Week 4, I designed a basic cat logo by combining different shapes and colours. Working with squares, circles, and triangles was simple for me, but learning how arcs function and how to code them effectively took some time. Even though I had a little trouble with them, the solution was simple to find with a little trial and error.

For Week 5, I designed an animation where four squares move continually from one corner to the other, giving the impression that they are travelling in a circle, creating an illusion that they are travelling in a circle using conditionals. This was the hardest of the three tasks for me. After multiple attempts I still cannot figure out where my codes have gone wrong and why the sqaures move at different speeds. I tried everything from changing the variables, changing the speed rate, changing the direction, to finally rewriting the entire code, but nothing seemed to work. Ultimately I had to move on in order to complete the other parts and turn in the assignment on time.

For Week 6, I designed an interactive game, where the goal is to free the square by successfully guiding it through the maze using conditionals and input from the user. Here, I initially struggled with what I wanted to achieve, but once I had a concept in mind, it was a little easier. The difficulties in this case were in determining the coordinates and the positions of the lines, but they were easily resolved with a little trial and error.

Overall, I had a great time working on this assignment and I can't wait to learn more things that will be really useful in real life.
