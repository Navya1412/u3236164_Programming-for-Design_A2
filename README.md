The goal of this assignment was to create websites each showing a different JavaScript skill I have learnt in the past 3 weeks in class.

For Week 4, I have created a simple cat logo combing various shapes and colours. Working with sqaures, circles and triangles were easy, whereas understanding how arcs works and how to properly code them took me a while. While I struggled a little with them, the end result was easily achieved after a ittle trial and error.
