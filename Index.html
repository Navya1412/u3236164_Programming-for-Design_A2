            The task for Week 4 was to design a Simple Logo - for which I designed a basic cat logo 
            using simple shapes. 
            <br><br>
            The task for Week 5 was to design a simple animation - for which I designed 4 squares
            going round and round creating an illusion that they are going in circles.
            <br><br>
            The task for Week 6 was to design an interactive artwork - for which I designed a simple
            maze game where the aim is to successfully free the square by navigating it around the maze.
